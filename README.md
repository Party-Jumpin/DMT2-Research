# technika-documentation
Contains (probably) useful information about the arcade version of DJMAX TECHNIKA 2.
# Information of various directories from .pak files
As of writing this readme, there are no (public) tools to extract the contents of Technika 2 International. I have recently discovered metadata from the pak files referencing various Adobe products. They also do not have obfuscation unlike the future title, TECHNIKA 3. Also, the directories of the pak contents are listed under "Client.exe". The game will read from the pak files first. Same goes for Technika 3. Removing the pak will make the game read DIRECTLY from the directory that this specific file is stored in. Keep that in mind.
# Client.exe informations
As of 7/21/2021, I have not found anything regarding an AES key/pak key. I will continue to investigate further. I have not checked for keys, and it will probably be a while before I crack down on them. I will be busy the following week (7/29) until late August. So this "project" is held off until my return.
